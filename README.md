### About me
After finishing the IT-HTL in Ybbs with my Major Internet- and Media I workes as C# Developer and Software-Tester in Vienna.
In October 2012 I started studying Business Informatics at the Johannes Kepler University Linz.
Additional to the Study I started working as IT-Allrounder and Driving Teacher at Easy Drivers. A year before I finished my Business Informatics Study I was recruited by epunkt to work as Active Sourcer with Focus on IT-Jobs and Softwaredeveloper.
In April 2019 I changed the department at epunkt and I'm now working as ❤️Software Developer, IT-Application and Projectmanager, with small steps I now learn new Stuff about Datawarehousing and already did my first few Reports 📊 I love it ❤️.
Thank you epunkt ❤️ Best Place to work! ❤️ [#epunktliebtdich](https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/epunktliebtdich/)
